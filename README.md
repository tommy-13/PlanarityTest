# PlanarityTest
 An implementation of the left-right planarity test.
 The implementation follows the paper <i>The Left-Right Planarity Test</i> by Ulrik Brandes.
 
 Note that the implementation has only been tested for a few family of graphs, so there is no warranty that it works in every case.
 
# Known issues
The translation from a rotation system (as a result of the left-right planarity test) to a drawing (using the algorithm of de Fraysseix, Pach and Pollack) is currently not working for all graphs.
